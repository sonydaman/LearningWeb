before starting anything in GITHUB
create an account in GITHUB
What is GITHUB?
is like a global folder which anybody can access from anywhere
i have a code in my machine that code only accessible in my machine
But i want to do somthing if my code can be access for specific people or anybody
to do that
we have to create a repositry(a link where we can push our code.)
repositry is kind of global folder which anybody can access
once we create a repositry after that we have to push our files or folder

is it free yes it is free
what are major advantages of GITHUB
suppose
i want to check what code i have been done by yesterday or any other day we can easily track
we can make differ branches in the same repositry
--PROJECT-- REPO
branches
--HOME--  
 --ABOUT--
--CONTACT--
GITHUB
CLONE the repositry
PULL from repositry
if any changes we have made COMMIT
-- stage
